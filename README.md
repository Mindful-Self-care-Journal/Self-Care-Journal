Journaling is a keystone habit that can improve your happiness and overall health. Writing in a journal with pen and paper is effective, but not as easily accessible, maintained, or preserved as taking advantage of digital platforms.

Having a journal that is available on any device makes journaling easier. Being tailored specifically to journaling makes it less cumbersome than trying to utilize a note taking app or document for recording thoughts and impressions.

Features
In the spirit of minimalism, a few key features are in place for a quick, lightweight journaling experience that can work across devices, including:

🔥 Authentication: Cloud firestore persists registered users to a users document and saved journal entries to an entries document
🎨 Theming: the src/styles/theme.js file contains a set of colors and default styles that are applied to components with Emotion. A default light and dark theme are already in the file (adding theme-ui support would be a great future addition)
🔍 Search: full-text search of a user's entries stored in Firestore for quick access to past entries
🖥 Mobile Friendly: designed to look great on mobile as well as desktop, with easy navigation on both
💡 PWA: being a progressive web app makes it installable from Chrome/Safari on desktop, or be added to the homescreen on iOS/Android
🔌 Offline Support: read/write when you're offline and let the updates happen when your connection is restored
🗄 Export: backup all of your entries at any time to save your data
